# ludum-dare-36
Source code for my Ludum Dare 36 (LD36) entry, Ancient Ciphers. The theme for LD36 is "Ancient Technology."

See it in action [here](https://townsean.github.io/ludum-dare-36/)! (A work in progress.)

## Synopsis

In Ancient Ciphers, players race against the clock to decode hidden messages.

## Motivation

When I brainstormed game ideas with an ancient tech theme the Caesar cipher popped into my mind.
